            <h1>NEET</h1>
        <p><pre>
            NEET stands for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, and it is a standardized entrance 
            examination in India for students aspiring to pursue undergraduate medical and dental courses.
             The test is conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on behalf of the Ministry of Health 
             and Family Welfare, Government of India.

Here are key points to help explain NEET:

Purpose:

NEET is the primary entrance examination for admission to undergraduate programs such as MBBS (Bachelor of 
Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) and BDS (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) in government and private medical and
 dental colleges across India.
Eligibility:

To be eligible for NEET, candidates must have completed their 10+2 (or equivalent) education with Physics,
 Chemistry, Biology/Biotechnology, and English. The minimum age requirement is 17 years.
Exam Pattern:

NEET is a pen-and-paper-based test with a duration of 3 hours. It consists of multiple-choice questions 
(MCQs) and covers subjects like Physics, Chemistry, and Biology (Botany and Zoology).
Syllabus:

The NEET syllabus is based on the CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) curriculum for classes 11 
and 12. It includes topics from Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.
Scoring:

Each correct answer is awarded four marks, and one mark is deducted for each incorrect answer. The total
 marks are used to calculate the NEET All India Rank (AIR) and determine eligibility for counseling and admission.
All India Quota and State Quota:

NEET provides for 15% of the total seats in government medical and dental colleges through the All India
 Quota (AIQ). The remaining 85% of seats are reserved for state-level counseling.
Counseling and Admission:

After the results are declared, candidates are required to participate in counseling sessions conducted 
by the respective state authorities or the Medical Counseling Committee (MCC). Seats are allocated based
 on merit and preferences.
Validity:

NEET scores are generally valid for the same academic year. Candidates need to appear for NEET every year
 if they wish to improve their scores or seek admission in subsequent academic years.
NEET is considered a crucial examination for students aspiring to pursue a career in medicine or dentistry 
in India. The standardized nature of the test ensures a fair and transparent selection process for 
candidates across the country. The examination is highly competitive, and successful performance in 
NEET is a key requirement for securing admission to medical and dental colleges in India.
