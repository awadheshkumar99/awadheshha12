            <h1>JEE</h1>
        <p><pre>
            JEE stands for the Joint Entrance Examination, which is a set of competitive examinations in India used
             for admission to various engineering programs. There are two main JEE exams:

JEE Main (Joint Entrance Examination - Main):

JEE Main is conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) in India. It serves as the first stage for admission to 
undergraduate engineering programs in top engineering institutes, including the Indian Institutes of Technology 
(IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs), and other centrally funded technical institutions.

The exam is typically held twice a year (January and April) and is open to students who have completed their 10+2 
(or equivalent) education with Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics as mandatory subjects.

JEE Main scores are also used by other institutions for their admissions, making it one of the most widely taken 
engineering entrance exams in India.

JEE Advanced:

JEE Advanced is the second stage of the Joint Entrance Examination and is conducted exclusively for admission to 
the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). Only students who qualify in JEE Main are eligible to appear for JEE Advanced.

JEE Advanced is considered one of the most challenging engineering entrance exams in the country. It evaluates 
candidates on their problem-solving skills, analytical abilities, and a deeper understanding of the subjects.

Admission to undergraduate programs in IITs is highly competitive, and JEE Advanced scores play a crucial role in
 the selection process.

Key features of JEE:

Examination Format: Both JEE Main and JEE Advanced consist of multiple-choice questions as well as questions that 
require detailed answers. JEE Advanced may also include questions with numerical answers.

Subjects: The exams typically cover Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics, reflecting the core subjects required for
 engineering education.

Eligibility Criteria: Candidates must fulfill certain educational criteria, often based on their performance in 
the 10+2 board exams.

Ranking: The results of JEE Main and JEE Advanced are used to rank candidates, and these ranks play a crucial 
role in the admission process to various engineering institutes.

Counseling Process: After the declaration of results, qualified candidates go through a counseling process to 
choose their preferred engineering colleges and branches based on their ranks.

JEE is highly significant for students aspiring to pursue undergraduate engineering education in some of the 
most prestigious institutions in India. The rigorous selection process ensures that successful candidates are 
well-prepared for the academic challenges in the field of engineering.
