            <h1>NUTRITION</h1>
        <p><pre>
            Nutrition is the process by which living organisms acquire and utilize the nutrients necessary 
            for their growth, development, maintenance, and overall well-being. It involves the intake, 
            absorption, utilization, and excretion of nutrients, which are substances that the body needs 
            to function properly. Nutrients can be classified into macronutrients and micronutrients:

            Macronutrients:
            
            Carbohydrates: The body's primary source of energy. Foods like grains, fruits, vegetables, and 
            legumes are rich in carbohydrates.
            Proteins: Essential for building and repairing tissues, enzymes, and hormones. Sources include 
            meat, dairy, legumes, and nuts.
            Fats: Another energy source and crucial for cell structure, hormone production, and nutrient 
            absorption. Healthy fat sources include avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil.
            Micronutrients:
            
            Vitamins: Organic compounds that play various roles in bodily functions. For example, vitamin C
            
            is essential for immune function, while vitamin D is important for bone health. Fruits, 
            vegetables, and fortified foods are good sources of vitamins.
            Minerals: Inorganic elements with diverse functions, such as calcium for bone health, iron for 
            blood formation, and zinc for immune function. Sources include dairy, meat, whole grains, and 
            leafy greens.
            Water:
            
            While not a nutrient, water is essential for life and is crucial for various bodily functions, 
            including digestion, temperature regulation, and waste elimination.
            The balance of these nutrients is essential for maintaining good health. Poor nutrition can lead
             to malnutrition, which can manifest as undernutrition (insufficient intake of nutrients) or 
             overnutrition (excessive intake of nutrients, often leading to conditions like obesity). A healthy
              and balanced diet is key to preventing nutritional deficiencies and promoting overall well-being.
            
            Individual nutritional needs can vary based on factors such as age, sex, activity level, health status,
             and specific dietary requirements. It's important to adopt a varied and well-balanced diet that meets
              these individual needs. Consulting with healthcare professionals or registered dietitians can provide
              
              personalized guidance for optimal nutrition
