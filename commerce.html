         In the CBSE curriculum for commerce, students typically study a combination of subjects that provide a strong 
         foundation in business, economics, and finance. The core subjects in CBSE commerce include:

       and bookkeeping.
        
       <h3>Business Studies:</h3>  It covers the fundamentals of business management, organization, marketing, and other
        aspects of running a business.
        
       <h3>Economics: </h3>Students usually study both microeconomics and macroeconomics, exploring concepts like demand
        and supply, market structures, national income, and economic policies.
        
       <h3>Mathematics:</h3> Mathematics is often an optional subject for commerce students, and it includes topics like
        financial mathematics, statistics, and business mathematics.
        
       <h3>English:</h3> Language skills are essential, and English is a compulsory subject for all streams.
        
        Informatics Practices/Computer Science: Many students opt for either Informatics Practices or Computer Science 
        to gain computer skills and knowledge.
        
        <h3> Optional Subject:</h3> Depending on the school and individual choices, students may have the option to 
        choose another subject, such as physical education, entrepreneurship, or multimedia and web technology.</pre></p>
